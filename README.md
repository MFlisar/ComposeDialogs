This library offers you an easily extendible compose framework for modal dialogs and allows to show them as a **dialog** or a **bottom sheet**.

## :camera: Screenshots

I only show the bottom sheet version for the info dialog, but of course any dialog does support the bottom sheet mode. Same holds true for the optional dialog icon.
