!!! info

    Version `2.*` is a kotlin multiplatform rewrite, that's why some fundamantal changes needed to be done!

#### Changed imports

* `com.michaelflisar.composedialogs.core.style.DialogStyle` => `import com.michaelflisar.composedialogs.core.styles.ComposeDialogStyle`
* `com.michaelflisar.composedialogs.core.style` => `com.michaelflisar.composedialogs.core.styles` (s added)
* Fixed wrong package names for all number dialog classes (**input** was renamed to **number**):
  * `com.michaelflisar.composedialogs.dialogs.number.DialogNumberPicker`
  * `com.michaelflisar.composedialogs.dialogs.number.NumberPickerSetup`
  * `com.michaelflisar.composedialogs.dialogs.number.RepeatingButton`
  * `com.michaelflisar.composedialogs.dialogs.number.rememberDialogNumber`

#### Structural changes

DialogState

* class `DialogState` was renemad to `DialogStateNoData` 
* `DialogState` is a now base class of `DialogstateNoData` and `DialogStateWithData`
* the show function is save now => `show(data)` can only be called from `DialogStateWithData` and `show()` only from `DialogStateNoData`
* the `showing` flag was renemad to `visible` (that name is more common in googles composables)

#### Note

I probably forgot some small changes because this was a big rewrite in KMP. Let me know if you find something then I'll add it here.
